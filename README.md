# cancerReportsClassification
This is the code that was used in the experiments for my PHD thesis ["Classification of cancer pathology reports with Deep Learning methods"](https://github.com/trianam/thesisPHD/raw/master/thesis.pdf) and for the paper "Classification of cancer pathology reports: a large-scale comparative study". The folder `old_experiments` contains the experiments related to the first part of the thesis, `new_experiments` related to the paper and the second part of the thesis. `glove` contains the code to train and evaluate the GloVe word vectors used in the experiments. For privacy reasons the data is not available.
